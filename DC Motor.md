# DC Motor Documentation


## 1. Introduction
### Overview
A DC motor is an electric motor that converts direct current (DC) electrical energy into mechanical motion. It is widely used in various applications, including robotics, automation, and motor control systems.

###Features
- Operating Voltage: Typically 3-24V (Depends on the motor model)
- Speed Control: Can be controlled by varying the voltage or using pulse width modulation (PWM)
- Direction Control: Can be controlled by reversing the polarity of the power supply or using an H-bridge circuit
- Torque: Varies depending on the motor model and voltage

### Pinout (Example):
- VCC: Power Supply
- GND: Ground
- IN1: Input 1 (Control signal for direction)
- IN2: Input 2 (Control signal for direction)
- PWM: Pulse Width Modulation (Controls motor speed)
## 2. Getting Started

### Hardware Setup
1. Connect VCC and GND to the power supply.
- DC Motor VCC pin to power supply positive terminal (Power Supply)
- DC Motor GND pin to power supply negative terminal (Ground)

2. Connect control pins to the microcontroller or motor driver.
- DC Motor IN1 pin to microcontroller GPIO pin or motor driver input pin
- DC Motor IN2 pin to microcontroller GPIO pin or motor driver input pin
- DC Motor PWM pin to microcontroller PWM output pin or motor driver PWM input pin

### Software Setup
- Initialize the microcontroller's GPIO pins or PWM module for the DC motor control.
- Configure the control pins as outputs for direction control.
- Configure the PWM pin for speed control .

## 3. Configuration

### Direction Control
Set the control pins to the desired logic levels to control the motor's direction.
For example, setting IN1 to HIGH and IN2 to LOW may rotate the motor in one direction, while setting IN1 to LOW and IN2 to HIGH may rotate it in the opposite direction.
### Speed Control
Set the duty cycle of the PWM signal to control the motor's speed. Higher duty cycles result in faster speeds, while lower duty cycles result in slower speeds.

## 4. Motor Operation

- Start the Motor
- Set the control pins and PWM signal according to the desired direction and speed.
- Activate the motor by providing power to the VCC pin.
- Stop the Motor
- Set the control pins to neutral or OFF state.

- Remove power from the VCC pin.
## 5. Advanced Features
### Motor Braking
- Implement electronic braking techniques to quickly stop the motor's rotation.
This can be achieved by shorting the motor terminals or applying a reverse voltage for a brief period.
### Motor Current Sensing
- Integrate current sensing techniques to monitor the motor's current for protection or feedback purposes.
This can be done using current sensors or by measuring voltage across a shunt resistor.

## 6. Troubleshooting
- Common Issues
- Motor Not Rotating
- Unstable Motor Operation
- Motor Overheating
- Debugging Tips
- Check wiring connections and ensure proper voltage levels.
- Verify the logic levels of the control pins and PWM signal.

## 7. Usage Examples
- Simple Motor Control
Provide a code example for basic control of a DC motor, including starting, stopping, and changing the direction.
- Speed Control using PWM
